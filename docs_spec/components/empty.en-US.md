### Component type

| Type | Description |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------- ----------------------------- |
| 1. Text type | Plain text prompt, less interference to users, but not easy to attract users' attention |
| 2. Customized illustrations + text styles | Illustrations and text descriptions that fit the current scene, have strong emotional expression, attract users' attention, and help improve product image, but they are more disruptive to users. |
| 3. Customized icon + text type | The icon plus text description that fits the current scene is easy to understand and easy for users to discover; but it has little difference from other products and lacks emotional expression. |
| 4. Customized illustrations/customized icons + button type | Icons/illustrations that fit the current scene and buttons that guide users to operate, highlight guiding users to perform other operations, minimize the cost of understanding the illustrations bring to users, and improve use efficiency. |

## When to use

When the user performs an operation and does not display the data (for example, when the search has no results).

1. **Text type**: Use when the controls on the page have no content, such as drop-down search, accordion, folding panel, shuttle box, drop-down menu, etc.
2. **Custom icon + text type**: Use when there are other content on the page and there is no data in a certain component or module, such as empty form, empty data graph, etc.
3. **Customized illustration + text type**: Used when there is no content on the page, such as no data on the page, network connection failure, no permission, 404, 405, etc.
4. **Customized icon/illustration + button type**: To help users get rid of the empty state, provide export or other function links.

## Layout

- Most icons/illustrations and text adopt **top and bottom** layout

## Copywriting Guide

- When there is information about emotional temperature, such as icons or illustrations, the empty state will feel better.

- To help users get rid of the empty state and enter the place where they can be operated, it is recommended to highlight the actions that the user can take.

- The text description recommends using a guiding tone instead of blaming and telling.

- It is recommended that non-visual information is clear and clear, and illustrations and icons are only auxiliary functions.
