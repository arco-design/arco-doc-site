- **Row Height**

Line height, also known as line spacing, can be used as a way to create density in a typographic layout. The line height of the text is directly proportional to its font size.

Larger line height: 44px, 40px; smaller line height: 36px, 32px, 20px.

- **Paragraph Spacing**

The consistent spacing makes the interface clearer and easier to navigate.

- **Centered:** When the text is aligned with the center of the area where it is located. Centered text is best used to distinguish short typographic elements in the layout (such as copy within quotes), and is not recommended for long copy.
