## How does ArcoDesign come into being

**ArcoDesign**Â is short for a set of design system.

-   The objective of ArcoDesign is to solve the experience problems occurred when using a product with a general design system and to provide guiding principles for product design to address problems occurred during the business. At the same time, it can also promote the cooperation between design department and R&D department and serve as the communication language among developers.
-   ArcoDesign mainly serves the experience design and technical realization in the middle and back-end products of Bytedance and is mainly constructed and maintained by UED designers and developers.

## Design Language - Pragmatic Romanticism

### ArcoDesign tries to establish a working mode

Pragmatism=Empathy; Romantism=Imagination

-   First, pragmatism allows design system to solve most of the needs to greatly improve efficiency. Based on this, designers & developers can do more "romantic" things, that is, to develop more innovative and imaginative outcomes.

-   On the product side, we can not only build basic functions pragmatically through the design system, but also use it to configure some romantic product pursuits.

-   Romanticism and pragmatism is not contradictory. The philosophy of design language is derived through the definition of romanticism and pragmatism, which runs through the entire design system. They are complementary to each other to influence the design direction.
